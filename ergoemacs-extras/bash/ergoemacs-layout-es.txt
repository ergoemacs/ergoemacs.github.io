# version: 1.1
# Author: Brendan Miller, Walter Landry
# Description: this file makes bash's editing shortucts to be ErgoEmacs keybinding, for ES layout.
# For layout of ErgoEmacs keys, see: https://ergoemacs.github.io/

# INSTALL
# to install, rename this file to just ".inputrc"
# place this file in your home dir. e.g. ~/.inputrc
# restart your terminal. Then, bash's keybinding for editing
# should be like ErgoEmacs.
# If no key works, try replace all \e to \M-. That's means change Esc to Meta key.

# doc about how to edit the bash keybinding, see:
# http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Readline-Init-File-Syntax.html
